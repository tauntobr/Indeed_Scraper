# Indeed_Scraper
Searches indeed.com and returns urls to resulting job application pages

When this script runs, the user is asked to input a job title or job-related keyword, as well as a geographic region such as a city name, province/state, or country. As of right now, the code uses ca.indeed.com, which focuses on Canadian searches. I have not yet tested the results of inputting non-Canadian cities/provinces.

The script uses Python 2.7.10, BeautifulSoup 4 and lxml. When editing and running the code on your computer, these packages need to be installed.

This is just a project for me to practice my coding skills and continue to improve myself. Input or commentary is welcome. 

On my PC I program Python using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 professional with Python Tools. I then copy/paste the code here.
